<a name="profile"></a>

**Software Engineer** <p align="justify">Previously I worked in the Visual Arts, though I also worked in Education at various stages, and in various capacities. I learn quickly and with lasting impact. I like to approach learning with fun, and be creative when there is space to be so. I made the shift to software development as I felt it aligned with my penchant for problem solving and constant learning. I am reliable, amicable and can pick up new concepts quickly with great drive and enthusiasm.</p>

## Education :school:

#### Makers Academy (April 2022 to August 2022)


- I pair-programmed extensively, maintaining composure and calm to maximise problem-solving as a duo.
- OOP: I learnt the foundations of object oriented programming in two dynamically typed scripting languages:[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/about/) and [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/learn).
- TDD: All coding was done following test driven development (or BDD), with testing frameworks such as [RSpec](https://relishapp.com/rspec) to ensure a robust codebase.
- Code Reviews: I completed numerous code reviews and group projects, assessing pull requests, and learning from observations made on my own code submissions.
- Team work: Most importantly I cemented the value of working effectively as part of a tech team, using Kanban software such as Github Projects, Trello, along with Agile methodologies in synchronous and asynchronous communication set-ups (principally through Slack).

## Skills

* ##### Team Player - Healthy communication and rapport building


I have extensive experience in working with teams made up of people from different cultures and backgrounds throughout my various professoinal roles, and in my personal life. I am a strong and considerate communicator, which has served as an asset on numerous occasions when working in large international teams; one example might be when I was involved in negotiating a partnership between a private school and the regional academic authority, Chiang Mai University, in northern Thailand, where I served as lead Academic consultant. The partnership was centered around the 28th point of the United Nationsâ€™ SDG initiatives. Given that my employer was Chinese, and our negotiating partners were a mixture of Western and Thai, there were cultural differences that extended to communication styles. My ability to manoeuvre varying modes of communication comfortably served as an asset in navigating what might have otherwise been unproductive meetings. Potential misunderstandings were diffused and the grounds for a robust partnership were agreed upon. I am always on the lookout for conferences/talks that I can learn from to reinforce this even more, the latest I attended was presented by Twilio,[here](https://yougotthis.io/collections/happy-healthy-communication).

* ##### Proactive learner

I engage in all activities I pursue whole-heartedly, and make it a point to learn around the topic at hand in order to get a more thorough and well rounded understanding. I like to learn in depth, and think of what I know in new ways, which is one of the reasons I love Ruby so much. There are so many ways to re-think about a given problem. I actively document my learning process in a book included on my website, [here](https://benjamin-neustadt.herokuapp.com/documentations).

I have learnt to use Vim, and have gotten into the habit of pairing exclusively through tmux ssh sessions whenever possible, as I have an obsession with doing everything through the command-line!
Since finishing Makers, I have continued to build apps specifically on the Sinatra and Rails frameworks - which can be viewed in my [repositories](https://github.com/BenjaminNeustadt?tab=repositories). The most recent example is my website, built using Sinatra, and deployed on Heroku. 

In terms of Kanban, I have continued to explore avenvues for streamlining my work process in order to be more effective in my work; I have recently taken to using [Taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/), an in commmand-line solution to Kanban, as well as [Timewarrior](https://timewarrior.net/).



* ##### Work ethic and discipline

I really thrive on being placed outside my comfort zone in all aspects of life. I enjoy challenges. 
Able to persevere through difficult experiences and learning curbs quickly, whilst maintaining focus. 
My persistent [contributions](https://github.com/BenjaminNeustadt) on my Github show my consistency in applying myself to pushing my skills further and further. More so than that, I think my detailed and meticulous process of organising my processes and understanding in [my book](https://benjamin-neustadt.herokuapp.com/documentations) show this also.
